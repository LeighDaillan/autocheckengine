Using top-tier synthetic base Engine Oil, AMSOIL Signature Series Max-Duty is naturally resistant to oxidation and the thickening effects of soot contamination. That, along with boosted detergent/dispersant additives, keeps soot particles suspended independently, helping prevent the formation of larger, wear-causing particles. Viscosity increase is minimized and soot-related wear is controlled. Lower volatility also helps Signature Series Max-Duty retain its viscosity after high-temperature service for maximum engine protection and efficiency.",
